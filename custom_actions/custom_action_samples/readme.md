This directory contains the sample custom action scripts used in the 04._postCustomActions.py sample.
These scripts will be uploaded to the QRadar system and can be executed as custom CRE responses (custom actions).

Users can define parameters to be passed to the custom action scripts at execution time, these basic samples
demonstrate how these parameters are accessed in each supported language.

Users can use the test execution screen on the 'Define Actions' admin panel to run the sample custom actions and see the 
parameters being printed. For custom actions to be usable they must first be deployed from the admin tab.
