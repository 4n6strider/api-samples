## Ariel API Sample Scripts

Scripts in this directory serve as an introduction to using the Ariel API.
Three use cases are provided:

### 01_GetDatabases.py

 This script calls the Ariel API to return a list of databases via a GET
 request.

### 02_SearchWorkFlow.py

 This script is a basic workflow for carrying out an Ariel Query. 

### 03_FaultyQuery.py

 This script is a Faulty Query to show how errors returned from the Ariel API 
 can be handled.

For a list of the endpoints that you can use along with the parameters
they accept you can view the REST API interactive help page at
`https://<hostname>/restapi/doc`
You can also retrieve a list of available endpoints through the api itself
at the  /api/help/capabilities endpoint
